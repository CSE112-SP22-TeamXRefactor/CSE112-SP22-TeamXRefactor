# Decision: Assigning Code Reviewers to Pull Requests 

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date of Last Significant Update: [2022-05-07] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement
[How do we choose who reviews our pull requests and keep track of that?]  

## Considered Options
* Keep a list of team members- request a review from the top member and then move their name to the bottom. That way the reviews always rotate through the whole team,
but it requires some manual management.
* Review by Volunteer: Simply ask the whole team and wait for people to volunteer to review.
* Keep a list of members, but keep a tally of how many pull requests someone has reviewed. Whenever you need a review, ask the people with the least amount of reviews.
Everyone is responsible for updating their own tally.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to go with the last option as it keeps a better overall picture of code reviews. It does still require some manual management but less than option 1.
