## Context and Problem Statement
For our To Do list core feature in our daily overview, the user has the ability to create bullet points which represents each of their tasks. We want to add nestability to these bullets since it makes sense to have sub-tasks within a task. Thus, we had to decide how many levels of nestability we wanted

## Considered Options
* a specific number of bullet nestability
* infinite number of bullet nestability

## Decision Outcome
We decided to go with option 2 and have a total of 3 levels of bullet nestability. The user has the ability to do a child of a child of a bullet at most. We chose to have a set number of levels for bullet nestability rather than an infinite number of bullet nestability because infinite nestability might become to messy & we wanted to keep our bullet journal as organized as possible.
