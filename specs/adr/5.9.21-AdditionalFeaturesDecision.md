# Bullet Journal Additional Features Decision

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date of Last Update: [2021-05-24] <!-- optional -->
  * We changed one of our additional features on the date above. We initially chose to have user customizability in relation to application themes on 5.9.21, but this has changed. See reasons for this and documentation below.

## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we need to have decided what additional features we want to focus on in addition to the core features. We didn't want to randomly pick additional features and we wanted to ensure that we
had enough time to implement these features without taking too much time away from our core feature development. So we had to figure out what additional features we wanted that would set us apart from others but also
not be too much to handle. The decision of implementing these additional features went alongside our user stories. These may be subject to change based off the time constraints, but, as of right now,
we plan to implement these.]


## Considered Options

* security related stuff (pin)
* user customizability (design personalization - push through this w our application especially prioritize this since we wonâ€™t be spending as much time on cloud based storage)
* photo + video + audio capture
* exporting data onto somewhere (export text file in a more presentable way -- csv or excel sheet) (this is optional)
* migration can be a very logical feature to include (especially for habit tracking - makes sense especially for the tracker feature to keep track of how well they're doing)
* having a unique set theme centered around our team logo and brand


## Decision Outcome
Past Chosen Option:  

**Updated Chosen Option: "[Security Related Stuff (PIN)]", "[Photo + Video + Audio Capture]", and "[Having a unique set semi-seasonal theme centered around our team logo and brand]" because:**
* having a PIN to secure the user's personal thoughts and tasks is an important feature to have because it is a given that individuals may not want their personal thoughts or writings being exposed. 
* we wanted to include photo and video capture within our bullet journal since we wanted to target a portion of our user audience who wanted to keep track of their everyday memories. Our photo & video capture within our daily overviews will be one of our most unique features.
* we wanted to have a unique set semi-seasonal theme that relates to our team logo, mascot, and brand that is feasible to implement under the time constraints & to separate us from others**
