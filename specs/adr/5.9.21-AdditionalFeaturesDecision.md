# Bullet Journal Additional Features Decision

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2021-05-24] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we need to have decided what additional features we want to focus on in addition to the core features. We didn't want to randomly pick additional features and we wanted to ensure that we
had enough time to implement these features without taking too much time away from our core feature development. So we had to figure out what additional features we wanted that would set us apart from others but also
not be too much to handle. The decision of implementing these additional features went alongside our user stories. These may be subject to change based off the time constraints, but, as of right now,
we plan to implement these.]


## Considered Options

* security related stuff (pin)
* user customizability (design personalization - push through this w our application especially prioritize this since we wonâ€™t be spending as much time on cloud based storage)
* photo + video + audio capture
* exporting data onto somewhere (export text file in a more presentable way -- csv or excel sheet) (this is optional)
* migration can be a very logical feature to include (especially for habit tracking - makes sense especially for the tracker feature to keep track of how well they're doing)
* having a unique set theme centered around our team logo and brand


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Security Related Stuff (PIN)]", "[Photo + Video + Audio Capture]", and [Having a unique set theme centered around our team logo and brand] because having a PIN to secure the user's personal thoughts and tasks is an important feature to have
because it is a given that individuals may not want their personal thoughts or writings being exposed. We also decided to include photo and video capture within
our bullet journal since we wanted to target a portion of our user audience who wanted to keep track of their everyday memories. We believe that our photo & video capture within our daily overviews
will be one of our most unique features & will set us apart from others. Lastly, we decided to now have a unique set theme that relates to our team logo, mascot, and brand. This unique theme will set us apart from others as well.
