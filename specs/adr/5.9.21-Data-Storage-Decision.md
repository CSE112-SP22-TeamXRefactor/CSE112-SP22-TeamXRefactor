# Bullet Journal Data Storage Decision

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date: [2021-05-09] <!-- optional -->

## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we need to have decided how we are going to store the notes, to-do lists, goals, and information of our users. It is important to know how we want to keep our user's data safe.] 


## Considered Options

* [Storing Data on a Cloud Based Platform]
* [Storing Data Locally on the User's Computer]

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[Storing Data Locally on the User's Computer]", because it reduces the security and dependency risks since the user's data will not be stored on any sort of cloud based platform. It will simply just be stored on the device of their choice. Moreover, after our research, we figured that many users simply just use their bullet journals to write what their feeling, what they need to do, and etc. as like a nightly or morning routine and don't necessarily write too much within their journals throughout the day. So having the data to be stored on the cloud wouldn't be as essential.  

### Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* less security and dependency risks
* less complex to implement, so we can spend more time on adapting/perfecting our additional features (photo + video API, user customizability, & etc.)

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->

* data not accessible on multiple devices at any time; syncing is not an option
