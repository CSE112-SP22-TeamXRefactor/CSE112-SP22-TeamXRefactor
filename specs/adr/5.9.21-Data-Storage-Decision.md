# Bullet Journal Data Storage Decision

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date of Last Update: [2021-05-19] <!-- optional -->
  * We changed our data storage decision on the date above. We initially chose to store our data locally on 5.9.21, but this has changed. See reasons for this and documentation below. 

## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we need to have decided how we are going to store the notes, to-do lists, goals, photos, images and information of our users. It is important to know how we want to keep our user's data safe.] 


## Considered Options

* [Storing Data on a Cloud Based Platform]
* [Storing Data Locally on the User's Computer]
* [Storing Data on a Database - IndexDB]

## Decision Outcome

Past Chosen Option: 

Updated Chosen option: "[Storing Data on a Database - IndexDB]", because we found that since we had to account for our photo album feature and storing images, we needed a database that would store (if needed) larger images. With storing bullets, notes, and images or videos, storing these things locally would have a size limitation so we decided to use IndexDB as our database. We were originally going to store things locally & use IndexDB for just our photo album feature, but we figured that it would be smarter to keep everything under one platform.

### Positive Consequences of most Updated Decision <!-- optional -->

* not as much size limitations on storing data such as images, videos, bullets and notes

### Negative Consequences of most Updated Decision <!-- optional -->

* data not accessible on multiple devices at any time; syncing is not an option
