# Bullet Journal Data Storage Decision

* Status: [Proposed & Accepted] <!-- optional -->
* Deciders: [whole team] <!-- optional -->
* Date of Last Update: [2021-05-19] <!-- optional -->
  * We changed our data storage decision on the date above. We initially chose to store our data locally on 5.9.21, but this has changed. See reasons for this and documentation below. 

## Context and Problem Statement
[For our bullet journal, we need to have decided how we are going to store the notes, to-do lists, goals, photos, images and information of our users. It is important to know how we want to keep our user's data safe.] 


## Considered Options

* [Storing Data on a Cloud Based Platform]
* [Storing Data Locally on the User's Computer]
* [Storing Data on a Database - IndexDB]

## Decision Outcome

#### Past Chosen Option:  
"[Storing Data Locally on the User's Computer]", because it reduces the security and dependency risks since the user's data will not be stored on any sort of cloud based platform. It will simply just be stored on the device of their choice. Moreover, after our research, we figured that many users simply just use their bullet journals to write what their feeling, what they need to do, and etc. as like a nightly or morning routine and don't necessarily write too much within their journals throughout the day. So having the data to be stored on the cloud wouldn't be as essential.  

#### Updated Chosen option:  
"[Storing Data on a Database - IndexDB]", because we found that since we had to account for our photo album feature and storing images, we needed a database that would store (if needed) larger images. With storing bullets, notes, and images or videos, storing these things locally would have a size limitation so we decided to use IndexDB as our database. We were originally going to store things locally & use IndexDB for just our photo album feature, but we figured that it would be smarter to keep everything under one platform.**

### Positive Consequences of most Updated Decision <!-- optional -->

* not as much size limitations on storing data such as images, videos, bullets and notes

### Negative Consequences of most Updated Decision <!-- optional -->

* data not accessible on multiple devices at any time; syncing is not an option
