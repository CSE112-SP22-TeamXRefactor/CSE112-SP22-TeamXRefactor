## Context and Problem Statement
[For planning sprints, we need a platform that allows us to see all our issues visually. Most importantly we want to be able to put visual estimates on every task and
assign them to specific sprints. The Github project board lacks these two key features: Estimating features and organizing sprints.]  

## Considered Options
* Continue to use the Github project board while organizing sprints and estimates in a Google doc.
* Migrate completely to a different Issue Management software.

## Decision Outcome
We decided to use Zenhub to solve this issue. Not only does Zenhub integrate naturally with Github, it shows estimates and sprint organization how we wanted.
Additionally it solves some of the overhead of having to manage everything manually on Google docs.
