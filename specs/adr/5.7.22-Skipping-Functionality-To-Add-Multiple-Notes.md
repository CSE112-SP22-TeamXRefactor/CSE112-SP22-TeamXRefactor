## Context and Problem Statement
[Is it necessary to allow user to create multiple notes on the Daily Overview page? If so, how can it be implemented naturally with the rest of the page content?]  

## Considered Options
* Allow user to create multiple note boxes within the page. May extend the length of the page and/or require moving page elements around.
* Create an option to swap between notes in the preset note box. This would not change the page layout.
* Skip the functionality altogether. The user can space out the notes themselves.

## Decision Outcome
We went with option 3. There is no need to add this feature as it might have negative effects to the user experience. The user can easily space out their notes to
organize as they please. Option 1 would mess up the page layout, and might show too much for the user to handle. Option 2 would hide information that the user might
be better served seeing right as they enter the Daily Overview page.
