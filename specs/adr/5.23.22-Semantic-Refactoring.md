## Context and Problem Statement
[Much of the HTML files are filled with <div> tags and such that could be refactored to use semantic tags. Additionally, some code dynamically generates HTML
that creates generic elements.]

## Considered Options
* Leave the code as is.
* Refactor HTML files and replace dynamically generated elements with custom or existing HTML elements.


## Decision Outcome
We decided to go with the second option of refactoring the code. With the use of semantic tags, browsers (and other developers) can interpret our website better.
Our website's SEO will also be better as a result. The custom elements should also improve the speed of our project.
