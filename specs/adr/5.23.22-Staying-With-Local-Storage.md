## Context and Problem Statement
[As our website uses local storage, the amount of data in the website depends on the space on the user's device. This could potentially cause issues for the user if they
have little space on their device. This also creates an issue for users who want to access their information on multiple devices, as their profile will only exist locally.]

## Considered Options
* staying with local storage
* Firebase (Cloud storage)


## Decision Outcome
We decided to stay with local storage. The bullet journal is mainly text, with the ability to add some photos. Thus, there is not a large amount of space taken up by the
local storage. It may be overkill to change to Firebase, and would require quite a bit of effort to modify the codebase to fit the new storage. Additionally, as a website
containing personal information that requires a fair amount of typing, the user will likely only use the bullet journal on a singular personal laptop or computer. While
the jump to Cloud storage may be beneficial later, at this stage, we have decided to spend our efforts elsewhere as local storage is adequate for our user's needs.
