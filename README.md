### How to set up eslint and prettier on VS-Code

1. run `npm install` in the root project directory (where the package.json is)
2. make sure to install the eslint extension for vscode

### Setting up auto-formating on save for js, html, and css files

TODO: For some reason there is no syntax highlighting for html and css files, but you are able to check the files directly from the command line using `npx prettier [filename]` and format them automatically using `npx prettier --write [filename]`.

1. install the prettier extension for vscode
2. in the vscode settings, under "defualt formatter" select prettier as your default formatter
3. enable "format on save"
