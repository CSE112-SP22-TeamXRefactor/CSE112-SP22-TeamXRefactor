## General stuff:
* Powell OH: best storage system is the one provided by the browser
* **Coming to Powell OH would be a good idea**
* It is alowed and encouraged to steal ideas (but not implementations!) from other teams
* [More notes from the Powell OH](https://github.com/cse110-sp21-group12/cse110-sp21-group12/blob/main/mil-notes/storage-5-3-21-Powell-OH.md) 
* **We are coding this week!!!**
* Idea: account system? or not?
* Thoughts: how much accessibility? how many features?
* What will security/encryption be like?
* Should improve communication by making new Slack channels (and using them)
* Adobe XD is good for UI
* We need more specific planning for what features we need
