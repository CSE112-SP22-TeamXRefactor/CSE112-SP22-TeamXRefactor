# Objective:
In this meeting, we plan to complete our group bonding activity (that we will decide upon during the meeting). Additionally, we are going to discuss the team’s brand/theme, the team page, and intro video.

# Agenda:
* Pick team bonding event
* Conduct team bonding activity
* Take screenshot of activity
* Discuss a team brand or theme
* “You will need to choose a team name and build a brand or theme around it. Branding materials could include (don't feel pressured to do all of these) team 
colors, a logo, a mascot, custom fonts, powerpoint themes, etc.”
* “You should use these branding materials on future presentations and assignments to reinforce your team identity to the class. Additionally you should set your slack workspace icon to an image that represents your brand and also incorporates your team number prominently.”
* Discuss and record short team intro video
* “You also should make a small 2.5 minute (max) video (MP4 or Quicktime format) that introduces your team.  Again, have fun with this as you see fit.”
“Your video should live in you repo at /admin/videos/teamintro.mp4”
* Discuss and create team page
* “Your team page should have the team name, brand, any values you think are important, and a roster of all the team members.  The roster should provide a brief overview of each member with a link to their personal Github page.”

# Deliverables (according to canvas):
* Keep your team branding materials in your repo at /admin/branding 
* Set your slack workspace icon to represent your brand and team number
* Place your team page at /admin/team.md and link to it from your README 
* Place your team video at /admin/videos/teamintro.mp4
