# Daily Standup Notes 6.4.21
* Scribe: Dustin

## General stuff:
* testing seems to be fixed, but still need to write more tests
* "encrpyting data" via Base64 is low prio to testing, group acknowledges that this may never get done
* make github public + make github pages
  * Done, realize many small errors on deplyment (mostly just misreferencing files)
  * Greated issues on github to keep track
* merged many small changes
  * small testing changes that work now
  * adding event collection and changing the highlighted day color
  * cleaning up codebase - deleting files and renaming to fit convention
  * changes to dropdown stlying colors
* meeting possibly monday to regroup
* Good Luck to everyone on the 101 final!
