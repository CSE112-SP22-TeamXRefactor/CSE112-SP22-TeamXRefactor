# Daily Standup Notes 5.17.21
* Scribe: Jackie

## General stuff:
* Each page of our application needs to have both style files ready (both the default dinosaur theme and customizable season theme)
* Team members need to take a look at the data storage txt file that was made so we can discuss it & how we are going to approach the backend side of things
* Went over types of bullets and the tags that would be associated with them
* Index page needs to be styled according to seasonal theme
* Research about backend needs to be done by everyone so we can tackle the function of our pages 
* Possible long meeting on Thursday or Friday so we can all work together
